# Lecture 0 Activity

In this lecture 1 activity, I will ask you to do several things:

1. Create a new file called 'activity.md`.

1. In this new file called `activity.md`, add a header of Level 1 called "Lecture 0 Activity".

1. Commit the change, add a comment about what it is.

1. Complete the [following survey to link your GitHub.com username to Canvas using your Student Number](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cBL3VbYixuY4oaq)

1. Edit the `activity.md` file, and answer the following questions:

    1. Have you ever used GitHub before? Yes/No
    
    1. Explain - in your own words - what is meant by "version control"
    
    1. Explain - in your own words - what you think is the difference between Git and GitHub.
    
    1. Add a link to your favourite restaurant in the city that you live in. Remember, you can add links to markdown files using this syntax:
    
    ```
    [name you want people to see](https://link.you.want.people.to.go.to)
    ```
    
    1. Add an image to your repository and describe it in 5 words or less. You can add an image by dragging and dropping the image in the main repository page. Once the image is in your GitHub repository, you can access it by specifying the PATH to it like this:
    
    ```
    ![](./image_name.png)
    ```
    
    If your file is not a png, then be sure to add the appropriate extension.

1. Submit a link to this commit on Canvas. For example, to get the link to this commit, see this screenshot on how to do it:

![](commit.png)

    It will look something like this: `https://github.com/ubco-W2020T2-cosc123/template_activity1/commit/4420fc48bfd3c7758cc634a484566a6a5c30a386`
