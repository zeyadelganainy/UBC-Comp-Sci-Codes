## Q7: Course Reflection (12 marks)

This is a question that will help you reflect on some things you've learned in this course, and take a "Big Picture" view of the course content.

**You should answer all of these questions in the file called [`A_Reflection.md`](../A_Reflection.md).**

### Part 1: Beauty (3 marks)

Consider **one** computer science concept from this course that you found **beautiful**; explain the concept, and why you found it beautiful. The definition of beautiful relevant for this question is: "pleasing to the senses or mind aesthetically."

You should have a minimum of 3-5 sentences to get full marks on this question and have the following requirements:

1. Explain the concept in a way that would be understood by a first-year student that has never taken a computer science class before. 

1. Address how this beauty is similar to, or different from other kinds of beauty that human beings encounter (in nature and in the world, etc...).

### Part 2: Imagination (3 marks)

How has your imagination been enhanced as a result of taking this class? Consider how the computational ideas discussed in this term benefit the Arts, Society, Culture, and Our world. 

You should have a minimum of 3-5 sentences to get full marks on this question and you should give at least three examples.

### Part 3: Untested Content (3 marks)

In final exams, it is often not possible to test every single concept or idea discussed in the term. 

Choose a concept or an idea that you studied for, or that was part of the course, **but wasn't tested on this final exam**. Clearly state the concept or idea, and then demonstrate your understanding of the concept by explaining it in words or code at the level of a peer in the class. 

You should have a minimum of 3-5 sentences to get full marks on this question.

### Part 4: Earned Grade (3 marks)

What grade do you deserve in this course and why?

As an educator, I am very aware that learning is not easily measured by scores on tests, and exams. There are many other ways and sources of learning, and I admit that not everything can be captured by the assessments that I give you.

Pretend that there were no guidelines in the syllabus for calculating your final grade. 
Based on the work that you have done all semester, and the learning goals for the course, what grade (out of 100) do you think you have earned? 

From the syllabus, here are the course goals:

You should take this course to see how art and coding can come together to produce wondrous creations. Our ultimate goal is to give you a more fun introduction to programming by allowing you to express your creativity. You will learn programming basics such as decisions, iteration, objects, methods, and classes through the Processing language. You will also explore events, graphics, animation, 2D gaming, and file manipulation while practicing programming concepts. By completing this course, I hope you will understand programming fundamentals, have created interesting and fun programs and animations, and have the ability to continue in following computer science courses.

Note that you will **not** be graded based on how accurate your deserved grade is to your actual grade. 

Try **NOT** to focus on calculating your earned grade and avoid mentioning or referring to average grades on the labs, tests, lecture activities, or even the posted grade with your grade before the final exam. 

What is some other evidence of your learning? Consider not just what you have learned, but how much effort you put into the course (and whether that effort was productive or not), and honestly assess how much of the material you feel truly *comfortable* with.

Your answer should be in two parts:

1. A number between 0 and 100 corresponding to your earned grade in this course.
1. Approximately 3-5 sentences with an explanation/justification of your earned grade.
