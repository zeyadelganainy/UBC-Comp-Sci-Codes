Q3)
a. 0xAD100000

sw $16 0($8) where $16 is rt, $8 is rs, and 0 is the offset. 
Based on the I-format it wold look like this:
1010	1101	0001	0000	0000 0000 0000 0000
In hexadecimal that would be 0xAD100000

b. 0001 00  10 000  1 0010  0000 0000 0000 0111
     op   |   rs   |  rt  |        offset
The offset is how many words ahead the label is from the instruction.
Here, exit is 7 instructions ahead so the offset is 7 (0111 binary is 7).
The equation for the offset is $pc + 4 + 4(offset) and when the condition
is true the value of pc is updated with the above equation. Using that in
this example gives $pc = $pc + 32 

c. Because the absolute address is divided by 4 and address of loop is
in 26 bits
00100 0000 0000 0000 0001 1100
divided by 4:
00001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0111
in hexadecimal that would be 0x08100007
