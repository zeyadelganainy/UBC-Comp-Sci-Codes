# Rules for the test

Read them carefully! Accepting this assignment you are agreeing to these conditions:

- You will have 75 minutes to complete the test (unless you have an accommodation from the DRC).
- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans - cats and dogs in the room are fine).
- You DO NOT need to add the units in to the answers, Canvas numeric fields require only the numbers.
- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etc...)
- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-web EXCEPT websites that help you cheat such as Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload (Stack Overflow is permissible).
- Copying the question text and googling IS CHEATING
- Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you IS CHEATING
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating.
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
- Do not be anxious about the test! If you donâ€™t do well - review the material and try again in a few days - we will take the better of the two marks!
- You will not be able to ask us questions during the quiz - do your best with your best interpretation.
- Do NOT share test questions with anyone until the Test window is complete - that IS CHEATING.
- Overall, do not stress! You will be fine :-)
