## Q8: Course Reflection (12 marks)

### Part 1: Beauty (3 marks)

> One concept that I found beautiful is the ability to generate aesthetically pleasing drawings from mathematical formulae. One of the simplest things to animate using math is 2 lines that rotate with a specific angel and that will print out a beautiful animation. It generates patterns similar to those found in video games or "ASMR videos"

### Part 2: Imagination (3 marks)

> Taking this class allowed me to think of the world differently. In a way, everything around us is animated and I often find myself wondering what complex variables would go into a code if I were to try to recreate these real life scenarios as animations. The computational ideas discussed in this course give an introduction to the world of computer science and computer creativity which is a field that its benefits can be seen all around us.

### Part 3: Untested Content (3 marks)

> Something that I've studied but was not tested on is the concept of loading an image into processing and working with it. The data type for an image would be "PImage" and to load it you use the method loadImage(source). To draw it, use image(image_name).

### Part 4: Earned Grade (3 marks)

1. In COSC 123, I believe I have earned a grade of: 95 %.

1. Here is my explanation and justification for this grade:

> I believe that I earn this grade because I came into this course already with a solid foundation in Java which was revised and strengthened when I took this course. I believe that I understand all the concepts taken in this class to a great extent and I did not have to spend as much effort as I did with a previous course which is equivalent to that one which means that my understanding of the concepts taught in this class is at a good level.
